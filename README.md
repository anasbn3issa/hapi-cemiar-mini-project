In this repository I am practicing basic concepts with HapiJS like : 
- Routing 
- templating with hbs 
- plugins (like : hapi-geo-locate, @hapi/inert, @hapi/vision and hapi-mongodb ) 
- connecting with mongodb database
- using OAuth with github to display userInfo (checkout /views/githubinfo.hbs and server.js)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependecies 
```sh
  npm install
  ```
2. And run the server
  ```sh
  nodemon server.js
  ```

## Why HapiJS 
Hapi.js comes with many unique features that enable developers to build secure, powerful, and scalable applications. Some of these features include:

1. End-to-end code hygiene which helps developers write manageable, controllable, and distributable code.
2. Secure defaults which are updated regularly. Hapi blocks error messages that may leak information or echo back exploits.
3. Encrypted and signed cookies, secret or key rotation, and HTTP security headers all meant to enhance the security of applications.
4. An extensive set of official plugins that are meant to replace middleware used in frameworks such as express.
5. Integrated Authorization and Authentication Architecture which is the most comprehensive authorization API available in Node.js.
